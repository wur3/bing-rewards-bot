# ping-awards

> A python script to automate a certain pyramid scheme. It's all about the $5 gift card every few months.

## Tutorial

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/wur3/ping-awards.git`

2. Go inside the directory with `cd ping-awards`

3. Install given requirements:
```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download chromedriver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.38/ into the ping-awards directory


5. Create a "login.txt" file to hold your login username/email and password (at least 2 lines)

  For example, `login.txt`
  ```
  [example]@gmail.com
  [example]
  ```

6. Create a "words.txt" file to hold at least 10 random words each on a separate line as your filler searches (at least 10 lines)

  For example, `words.txt`
  ```
  pizza
  pokemon
  reddit
  sanic
  ugandan knuckles
  watermelon
  internships
  having a ball
  overwatch
  best search engine
  ```

7. Run `python3 main.py`

8. Profit at an atrociously slow rate. It's a pyramid scheme for crying out loud.
